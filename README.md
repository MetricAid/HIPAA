### Prerequisites

- Ruby
- Bundler
- Sass

### Local Setup

- Clone this repo, `git clone https://github.com/catalyzeio/catalyze-engineering-blog.git`
- Navigate to this repo, `cd catalyze-engineering-blog`
- Install gems, `bundle install`
- Run the server, `rake run`
- View the site locally, `http://localhost:2113`

### Writing Guide

Engineers are required to write a blog post at the conclusion of each project or at their own discretion throughout the course of a project. Topics are entirely up to each individual, but should focus on some technology being used at Catalyze or of interest to the engineer.

There are no hard requirements for blog posts, but they should be grammatically correct and intriguing to read.

Engineers are encouraged to mix up posts between long form articles detailing an entire project to short snippets and tutorials.

Posts can include media such as images, video and audio.

#### The following instructions detail how to create and publish a new post:

**[If you're not up for a read you can view this video that will tell you how to publish a new blog post.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/3b3kg4fwicw7hpr/how_to_blog.mov?dl=0)**

#### 1. Create a new draft branch

_Once you have the repository cloned, have pulled/checked out `master` and running locally you'll want to create a new branch for your post:_

```
$ git branch d-<topic>-<lastname>
$ git checkout d-<topic>-<lastname>
```

If you have two drafts going at once you'd simply add a number after `draft`:

```
$ git branch d2-<topic>-<lastname>
```

#### 2. Write your post with proper file name and frontmatter

Now that you're on a new branch you can start writing your post. Below is a template for new blog posts:

```
---
title:
date: yyyy-mm-dd
author:
author_full:
author_alt:
tags:
---
```

**`title`:**
Corresponds to whatever you want to name your blog post. It does not have to match the file name.

**`date`:**
Should correspond to the date the article is intended to be published. It should also match the date in the file name. If it does not match the date in the file name the build will fail.

**`author`:**
Corresponds to an image of the author. This bit should be your first name only and all lowercase.

**`author_full`:**
The full name of the author that wrote the article. Whatever is written here will be displayed with the post next to the image corresponding to author.

**`author_alt`:**
This will display some note about the post. It is most commonly used to give a second author credit.

**`tags`:**
Tags are used as a way to give the reader a quick overview what topics to expect out of the current article. Tags should be consistent throughout the blog. This means words like HIPAA are spelled in all caps.

#### 3. Push your new draft branch to github and create a PR

Once you've written your post, named the file correctly, and filled in all frontmatter you can push up your new branch:

```
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "New Post"
$ git push --set-upstream origin d-<topic>-<lastname>
```

From here you'll want to visit the github repo and create a new PR branching from master. Once the PR is up you should ask around for feedback and editing assistance from other engineers. We'd like to stick to a publishing schedule so PRs should be reviewed and merged within a day or two.

**Note: During this step it's also important to make sure that the `rake build` tasks succeeds. Fortunately this is automated with Codeship. You can either view the Codeship status badge at the top of this README (gray = running, red = failed, green = success), or ask [Ryan](mailto:ryan@catalyze.io) for access to the Codeship dashboard.**

#### 4. Merge your draft branch into master

Now that someone has reviewed your new post and all proper editing has taken place we can now merge into master. This is done simply via the UI in github. This merge will automatically trigger a test and deployment from Codeship. The status of the build will post within a few seconds to the open source channel.

#### Media requirements

**Images:**
Images should always be optimized and saved for the web. It's not reasonable to expect every engineer to have a copy of photo editing software on their machine. Therefore we encourage the use of free tools such as [kraken.io](https://kraken.io/web-interface). If engineers require graphics for their post they may reach out to any designer at Catalyze for assistance.

**Audio:**
Engineers are encouraged to use [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/) for audio snippets.

**Video:**
Videos can be taken either with QuickTime and uploaded to YouTube or with [Quickcast](http://quickcast.io/).

### Publishing

Publishing is handled by Codeship. Any push to master results in a deployment to the blog server on digital ocean.
